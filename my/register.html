    <p>In Computer Architecture, the Registers are very fast computer memory which is used to execute programs and operations efficiently. but In that scenario, registers serve as gates, sending signals to various components to carry out little tasks. Register signals are directed by the control unit, which also operates the registers.

    </p>
    <p> 
        The following list of five registers for in-out signal data storage:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Program Counter : </b>
                     A program counter (PC) is a CPU register in the computer processor which has the address of the next instruction to be executed from memory. As each instruction gets fetched, the program counter increases its stored value by 1. It is a digital counter needed for faster execution of tasks as well as for tracking the current execution point. 
            </li>    
            <li>
               <b>Instruction Register : </b>
                    In computing, an instruction register (IR) is the part of a CPU’s control unit that holds the instruction currently being executed or decoded. The instruction register specifically holds the instruction and provides it to the instruction decoder circuit. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Memory Address Register : </b>
                    The Memory Address Register (MAR) is the CPU register that either stores the memory address from which data will be fetched from the CPU, or the address to which data will be sent and stored. It is a temporary storage component in the CPU(central processing unit) that temporarily stores the address (location) of the data sent by the memory unit until the instruction for the particular data is executed. 

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Memory Data Register : </b>
                    The memory data register (MDR) is the register in a computer’s processor, or central processing unit, CPU, that stores the data being transferred to and from the immediate access storage. Memory data register (MDR) is also known as memory buffer register (MBR). 

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>General Purpose Register :</b>
                    General-purpose registers are used to store temporary data within the microprocessor. It is a multipurpose register. They can be used either by a programmer or by a user.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Registers are essential for efficient and high-speed computing operations.
