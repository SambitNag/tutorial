        <!-- <h1>Central Processing Unit(CPU)</h1> -->
    </hr>
    <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It performs most of the processing inside a computer, executing instructions from programs through basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>
    <p> Here are the key components and functions of a CPU:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Control Unit (CU) : </b>Directs all the operations of the CPU by fetching instructions from the memory, decoding them, and executing them, coordinating the activities of the computer's other hardware components.
            <li>
                <b>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) : </b>Performs arithmetic and logical operations. It handles operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logical operations like AND, OR, NOT.
            <li>
                <b>Registers : </b>Small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data temporarily during processing. Common types of registers include the accumulator, instruction register, and program counter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cache Memory : </b>A small amount of high-speed memory located within the CPU or close to it, used to store frequently accessed data and instructions, thereby speeding up processing by reducing the time to access data from the main memory.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Clock Speed : </b>Measured in gigahertz (GHz), it indicates how many cycles per second the CPU can execute, affecting the speed and performance of the processor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cores : </b>Modern CPUs have multiple cores, each capable of executing its own tasks independently. Multi-core processors can handle multiple processes simultaneously, improving overall performance and multitasking.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bus Interface : </b>The system bus allows the CPU to communicate with other components of the computer, such as memory, input/output devices, and secondary storage.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The CPU's efficiency and capability significantly influence the performance of a computer system, making it a crucial component in both personal and enterprise computingÂ environments.
